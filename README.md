# Deep Learning for Bradycardia Prediction

## Description

Deep Learing based prediction of a cardiac arrhythmia (bradycardia) in infants using ECG signal. The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://physionet.org/content/picsdb/1.0.0/). 

## File description

- [models](./models/) -> This directory contains code for EncoderAttention, Encoder with BCE Loss, Fully Convolutional Network, Inception Time, and Sequence-to-Sequence models.

- [DataExtraction.ipynb](./DataExtraction.ipynb) -> This notebook is used for extracting ECG values and annotations from the data files, and storing the retrieved values as `.csv` files.
